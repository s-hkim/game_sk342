**How to play the game:**  
>This is a 2-player fighting game. (But a single person could control both characters)  
>In "stock mode", reduce the opponent's health to zero to win.  
>In "timed mode", inflict the most damage before the timer hits zero to win.  

**Keys/Mouse input:**  
>WASD: Player 1 movement  
>F,G,H: Player 1 light hit, medium hit, hard hit  
>UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Player 2 movement  
>I,O,P: Player 2 light hit, medium hit, hard hit  

>DOWN -> FORWARD -> LIGHT/MEDIUM/HARD will shoot a fireball  
>The keys must be inputted quickly in sequence, and LIGHT/MEDIUM/HARD results in different fireballs

**Cheat Keys:**  
>Press ENTER to display Player 1's key inputs (for debugging).  
>Press SPACE to reset both player's health to 100.  

**Known bugs:**  
>Sometimes when a character is hit multiple sprites will appear on screen.  
>Occasionally the fireball launching animation does not play.

**Extra features:**  
>Multiplayer!  

**Impressions/Suggestions:**  
>I spent too much time working on animations.
